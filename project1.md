## Submission Guidelines

<b> If your submission does not comply with the following guidelines, you'll be given ZERO credit </b>

### File tree and naming

Your submission on Canvas must be a zip file, following the naming convention **YourDirectoryID_proj1.zip**.  For example, xyz123_proj1.zip.  The file **must have the following directory structure**. 

YourDirectoryID_proj1.zip.
 - train_images/.
 - test_images/.
 - results/.
 - GMM.m
 - trainGMM.m
 - testGMM.m
 - measureDepth.m
 - plotGMM.m
 - report.pdf

### Report
For each section of the project, explain briefly what you did, and describe any interesting problems you encountered and/or solutions you implemented.  You must include the following details in your writeup:

- Your choice of color space, initialization method and number of gaussians in the GMM
- Explain why GMM is better than single gaussian 
- Present your distance estimate and cluster segmentation results for each test image
- Explain strengths and limitations of your algorithm. Also, explain why the algorithm failed on some test images

As usual, your report must be full English sentences, **not** commented code. There is a word limit of 1500 words and no minimum length requirement

## Collaboration Policy
You are encouraged to discuss the ideas with your peers. However, the code should be your own, and should be the result of you exercising your own understanding of it. If you reference anyone else's code in writing your project, you must properly cite it in your code (in comments) and your writeup. For the full honor code refer to the CMSC426 Fall 2018 website.
