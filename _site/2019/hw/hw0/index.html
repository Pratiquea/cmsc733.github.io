## Phase 1: Shake My Boundary</p>

<p><a name="intro"></a><br />
### Introduction<br />
Boundary detection is an important, well-studied computer vision problem. Clearly it would be nice to have algorithms which know where one object stops and another starts. But boundary detection from a single image is fundamentally diffcult. Determining boundaries could require object-specific reasoning, arguably making the task hard.</p>

<p>Classical edge detection algorithms, including the Canny and Sobel baselines we will compare against, look for intensity discontinuities. The more recent pb (probability of boundary) boundary detectors significantly outperform these classical methods by considering texture and color gradients in addition to intensity. Qualitatively, much of this performance jump comes from the ability of the pb algorithm to suppress false positives that the classical methods produce in textured regions.</p>

<p>In this homework, you will develop a simplified version of pb, which finds boundaries by examining brightness, color, and texture information across multiple scales. The output of your algorithm will be a per-pixel probability of boundary. Several papers from Berkeley describe their algorithms and how their methods evolved over time. Their source code is also available for reference (don’t use it). Here we investigate a simplified version of the recent<br />
work from <a href="google.com">this paper</a>. Our simplified boundary detector will still significantly outperform the well regarded Canny edge detector. Evaluation is carried out against human annotations (ground truth) from a subset of the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set 500 (BSDS500).</p>

## Submission Guidelines</p>

<p><b> If your submission does not comply with the following guidelines, you’ll be given ZERO credit </b></p>

<h3 id="file-tree-and-naming">File tree and naming</h3>

<p>Your submission on Canvas must be a zip file, following the naming convention <strong>YourDirectoryID_hw1.zip</strong>.  For example, xyz123_hw1.zip.  The file <strong>must have the following directory structure</strong>, based on the starter files</p>

<p>YourDirectoryID_hw1.zip.<br />
 - data/. <br />
 - plot_eigen.m.<br />
 - least_square.m.<br />
 - report.pdf</p>

<h3 id="report">Report</h3>
<p>For each section of the homework, explain briefly what you did, and describe any interesting problems you encountered and/or solutions you implemented.  You must include the following details in your writeup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your understanding of eigenvectors and eigenvalues</li>
  <li>Your choice of outlier rejection technique for each dataset</li>
  <li>Limitation of each outliers rejection technique</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual, your report must be full English sentences,<strong>not</strong> commented code. There is a word limit of 750 words and no minimum length requirement</p>

<p><a name="coll"></a><br />
## Collaboration Policy<br />
You are encouraged to discuss the ideas with your peers. However, the code should be your own, and should be the result of you exercising your own understanding of it. If you reference anyone else’s code in writing your project, you must properly cite it in your code (in comments) and your writeup.  For the full honor code refer to the CMSC426 Fall 2018 website</p>
